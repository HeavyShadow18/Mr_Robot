A Reverse Shell is the most common type of shell, as it is the quickest and easiest method to obtain control over a compromised host. Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a netcat listener on our machine that listens on a specific port, say port 1234. With this listener in place, we can execute a reverse shell command that connects the remote systems shell, i.e., Bash or PowerShell to our netcat listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system.
